- Version 1.5.5: Added weighted option to compute distances between objects when replicates are available

### Package suffered major revisions since version 1.3 ###

Major changes from Version 1.3, mainly affecting the clusGPS function

- Removed existing distance transformation before clustering if no clustering object was provided
- Changes in the behaviour of clusGPS function, it can only be used with an external precomputed clustering object now
- Added preMerging to clusGPS step to ensure a minimum epigenetic cluster size
- Added function mergeClusters to perform unsupervised cluster merging based on spatial overlap and changepoint detection
- Posterior probabilities of clusters are now adjusted on the fly (much faster)
- Posterior probabilities are now weighted according to the size of each cluster
- New function to profile epigenetic clusters
- Moved grid density calculation out of clusGPS function
- Updated plot method for clusGPS objects

Other changes from Version 1.3

- Added function to export chroGPS maps to Cytoscape
- Added dynamic vignette with code for replicating toy analysis
- Added accessor functions for S4 classes
- Added stress measure for goodnes-of-fit of MDS objects
- Fixed bugs in R-Square calculation of some distance metrics
- Changed the available data object and object names
- Introduced mahalanobis distance in distGPS
- Updated examples and documentation
- Fixed bug in boostMDS, not properly using random seed in all cases

Major changes in Version 1.20

- Replaced GRanges/GRangesList class with GRanges/GRangesList
